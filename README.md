Introduction:
The teacher/student environment is a highly complex and difficult scenario for a multitude of reasons. Students now more than ever come to college not because they want to or feel like they should. Rather itâ€™s an expectation, an extension of high school which has resulted in dramatic difference in cognitive ability and motivation. These differences have made it difficult to address what is and is not the best way to address problems that arise from the students delivery of the content and over all environmental issues. Our software addresses a clear need for quantifiable information over classes, cognitive ability, and motivation. This data will allow for a more informed view of the trends of the development of students and in time will be able to tell if changes are effective or are needed.

Mission Statement	
Our mission is to facilitate curriculum understanding though the progression data, study environments, and topic analyst.
